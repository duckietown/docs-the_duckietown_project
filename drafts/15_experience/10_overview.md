* `duckietown-instructors.slack.com` is for instructors that teach the Duckietown class, or use the Duckietown platform as support to more traditional teaching activities.

* `duckietown-foundation.slack.com` is for the project staff.

Furthermore, we have the communities Slacks;  `duckietown-![community].slack.com` is the Slack for each regional community. For example, `duckietown-italy.slack.com` is the Duckietown for the Italian community.
